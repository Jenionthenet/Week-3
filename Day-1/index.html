            <p>When I was a young girl in the 90s, I had daydreams of seeing the world.  I would have never imagined that I would get the chance
                to see many of the places that I've been.  Prior to making the change to learn how to code and become a software developer, I was a teacher both in the USA,
                as well as abroad. One of the great benefits of teaching abroad was the ability to travel to distant places that would have otherwise been much more expensive to get to.
                Because I lived in Guangzhou, China for three years and taught at an internatinoal school, I was able to travel to a few asian cities and countries.  I also was able to travel to London,
                which is of my favorite cities to visit, especially during the Christmas season.
